## Day 1 ##

1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp
   Jacob's word: "Blockchain is an open, decentralized, shared database that allows anyone to store stuff publically". 
   blockchain is open to be interact with and public with its data(while not all of that for privacy focus blockchain), supports smart contract deployment and 
   maintained by decentralized computing machines which make it difficult to be exploited.

2. Explain what a Smart Contract is. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts
   Smart contract is fuctions that anyone can call which means interact with it to run a programmed code when deployed on the smart chain.

3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.
   A successful transaction changes some data on blockchain so we need to pay with gas fees.
   A script is used to view the data and do not cost money since some organizations are maintaining the data. They're the mining guys.    
   
   Thanks for reviewing my answer! have a nice day!
   
## Day 2 ##
1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
   Safety and Security, Clarity, Approachability, Developer Experience(I like it), Resource Oriented Programming.

In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
   There're so many attack on smart contract just because the contract creators cannot handle the complexity for very big contract and investors lost their fund. 
   One of the best way to fix this is by Clarity and Approachability which enable the coders to reduce their coding fault at the very beginning time.
   Also I prefer the programming language with better developing experience which saves my life and let me focus on something really important.
